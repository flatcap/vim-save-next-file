INTRODUCTION                                            *save-next-file*

Imagine you're working on a file and you want to quickly save a new copy.
This plugin will take the filename and generate a new name.

The old file will remain unchanged from the last, manual, save.
The new file will contain the, previously, unsaved changes.

Note: Existing files will be skipped.
